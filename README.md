Overall details:
- Developed a Random Forest Classification machine learning model that predicts if a vehicle requires maintenance
- Improved model compatibility by encoding categorical variables into numerical representations using OneHotEncoding
- Reduced dataset bias by balancing the dataset with the use of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) 
- Optimized model performance by finding and implementing the ideal combination of model hyperparaneters using RandomizedSearchCV
- Acheived an accuracy score of 95.94% and a F1 score of 95.93%, illustrating high model accuracy, precision, and recall
